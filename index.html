                I am originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganzhou">Ganzhou</a>, a small city in the mountains
                of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi">Jiangxi</a> province in southern China 🇨🇳.
                It's famous for its mandarin oranges 🍊, but personally I am not a fan of the fruit. The city is also
                famous for its rare earth deposits, but I can't eat those either 🙁

                I graduated from Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN 🇺🇸, with a Bachelor's in Computer Science (Class of 2019),
                and a Master's in Computer Science (Class of 2021).

                The 6 years I spent in Indiana was one of the most memorable time of my life. I always think back and cherish those days.
                Ever grateful ever true, hail hail to old Purdue!

            <h2 class="content">
                In school, I worked as a teaching assistance, where I helped taught a wide range of courses. From the basics of
                Computer Architecture (like building a traffic light with logic gate and switches on a breadboard), to Relational Database
                and Computer Security. I also worked as a research assistant in projects on Blockchains, under the supervision
                of <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/akate/">Prof.Aniket Kate</a>
                <br>
                <br>

                Prior to join S3, I worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/">AWS EFS</a> for 3 years,
                in Boston, MA 🇺🇸, where I worked to build and maintain distributed NFS servers. I started in the team as an intern in Summer 2020, so this is where I started my career. I am always grateful for the
                guidance and mentorship I received at EFS, which laid the foundation for my career and helped me become a stronger
                engineer now.
